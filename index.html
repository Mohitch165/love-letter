        <section class="modal-content">Hey Baby,<br><br>I miss you so much right now and I'm hurting so bad for all the havoc I've created. Honestly it's been so hard these past few days, I'm sure it's been way more harder for you, But I've come to realise how much you matter to me and how much I love you. It was an eye opener for me, if anything it's only brought me more closer to you and bring forward the flaws in me. Ever since I've met you you never fail to amaze me every single time I'm with you, everytime I'm feeling so content and tell myself it can't get better than this and there you'd show up outdoing yourself and making it even better than last time. I've always told you that I must've done some good deeds in my past life that I've you in this one, you've no idea how much I love you and how eternally I'm to have you by my side. What I did was wrong baby I realise that now, out of fear of losing you I kept making this worse to the point where we are hear now. But I promise you I had no intentions of doing anything behind your back or have any interest in anyone else, <br><br>I've realised that no matter how much I justify what I said and did it'll still look wrong to you and only hurt you more. So I'm only going to beg you for your forgiveness until I can look upto you again, no matter how long that takes. I love you more than anything and I'm not gonna give up on you or us no matter how long it takes. Being with you feels like coming back home after a really rough day at school and falling asleep in my moms lap, it feels home and I'm blessed to have that feeling with a woman who's not my mom, eternally grateful and blessed to have that feeling with you. I love you so much, I miss you so bad right now, I wish I good give you a tight hug, hold you and sleep next to you. <br><br><br>Love,<br>- Your shitty, useless boyfriend.</section>
